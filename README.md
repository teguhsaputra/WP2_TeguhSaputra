Hello, I'm Teguh Saputra.

I'm passionate about creating applications and enjoy watching anime in my free time. By profession, I work as a Web and Mobile Application Developer. My career allows me to combine my love for technology with my creativity to develop innovative and user-friendly applications. When I'm not coding or designing, you'll often find me immersed in the captivating world of anime, exploring its diverse genres and stories.

I look forward to connecting and sharing my experiences with fellow enthusiasts in both the tech and anime communities.
